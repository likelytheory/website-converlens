        <h2>Background</h2>
        
        <p>Converlens is an Australian based company building an AI driven stakeholder engagement platform that gives people a voice and, more critically, government the tools to listen and understand what's being said. This means analysis, data exploration and reporting, providing tools to ask questions of data like "show me the key themes discussed by young women expressing highly negative sentiment and mentioning the Minister of Parliament".</p>
        
        <p>On the back of successful proof of concept that ended in Oct 2018, we're now  moving into the commercialisation phase - and are working with several federal government agencies in Australia, including the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, the Department of the Prime Minister & Cabinet, and the Department of Education on some pretty cool projects (like the National Hydrogen Strategy and the A.I. Futures projects).</p>
        
        
        <h2>The Role</h2>
        
        <p>We're looking to hire a flexible Javascript/Typescript coder with experience working across the frontend and backend. The role is a full-time 3 month contract @ R50k/mo, based out of Cape Town, to help us smash out some of the key features we'd like to bring to market in that time period. We may look to extend the contract beyond the 3 months, but this is something we'll discuss with you down the track.</p>
        
        <p>The role is remote (as is the company), but we're hiring in Cape Town because that is where one of our founders (and tech lead) is currently based - so it'd be great if we were able to catch up face-to-face from time-to-time. The role is full-time, but we're flexible with hours that would work for you.  Our core team is currently 2 full timers and 1 consultant.</p>
        
        <p>Our stack is:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Language: Typescript</li>
        <li>Frontend: Preact/Redux</li>
        <li>Backend: NodeJS</li>
        <li>DB: Postgres</li>
        <li>AI services: Python</li>
        <li>Infrastructure: Docker/Kubernetes on GCP</li>
        <li>VCS: git</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>You</h2>
        
        <p>The ideal candidate for us would be someone who:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>works well remotely: good communicator, great written skills, self-directed and able to problem-solve independently</li>
        <li>knows coding: bonus if you're familiar with the stack we use, and bonus if you Typescript. We'll want to see code you've written, but also, tell us about projects you've worked on, challenging stuff you've dealt with, what you're most proud of, etc. We're gonna throw a lot at you, and you'll be able to really get involved in the code base (60kloc+ and growing), so you'll need to be confident in your skills and comfortable diving into the deep end!</li>
        <li>works across frontend and backend. You _will_ be working across both sides of the divide, so at least some familiarity with that will help the case. You don't need to know React or Node in depth, but familiarity would be ideal. We will expect you to be fluent in JS (bonus for TS). The main thing we're looking for is a confident, skilled coder. Frameworks can be learned and you'll have support to do so from us.</li>
        <li>can take direction and deliver: we have a clear picture of what we need to do and how to do it. You'll need to be at ease learning new code bases, adapting to our code style, and smashing deliverables out as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Next steps</h2>
        
        <p>If you're interested in the role, here's what we'd like to see from you:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Code you've written: ideally something on Github/lab we can take a look at (please don't send us code you do not own the license to)</li>
        <li>Projects you've worked on: we're interested here mostly in what _you_ were responsible for. Your experience.</li>
        <li>What "level" dev do you consider yourself? Junior, mid-level, senior, lead?</li>
        <li>Tell us what your current go-to tech stack/pipeline/toolset is</li>
        <li>What languages have you used in depth before?</li>
        <li>What _don't_ you like working on? (DBs, CSS, UX, pipeline, whatever)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Send your application to:</b> <a href='mailto:jobs@converlens.com'>jobs@converlens.com</a></p>
        
        <p>If you don't have code you can share, that's not the end of the world, but we'll ask you to knock something up that we can look at.</p>
        
        <p>We're looking to fill this role as soon as possible, so if you're able to start soon, that would be helpful! Send us your feedback on the above items we're looking for details about, and we'll reach out in reply to advise of next steps. Thanks for taking the time to read through this, and mention "Rainbow Pony" in your email for bonus points and added consideration from our side.</p>
        
        <p>We'll look forward to hearing from you!</p>
