											<h3>Independent Review of the Australian Public Service</h3>
											<p>In 2018 the Australian Federal Government established an independent review to ensure the APS was fit-for-purpose for the coming decades. The review was one of the largest reviews of the Australian Public Service undertaken in recent decades and Converlens played an integral role in capturing, managing and analysing data that informed the final recommendations.</p>

											<h3>Review of the Melbourne Declaration</h3>
											<p>Throughout 2019, the Education Council of Australia ran a substantial consultation that reviewed the Melbourne Declaration which was established in 2008. Informed from the insights gained from the consultation, and built on past declarations signed in Hobart, Adelaide and Melbourne over three decades, Education Ministers established The Alice Springs (Mparntwe) Education Declaration in December 2019. This declaration sets the strategic education goals for Australia and Converlens was proud to enable the online consultation for the review.</p>
