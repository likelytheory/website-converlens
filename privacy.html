                        <h3>3. How we collect your personal information</h3>

                        <h3>4. Use of your personal information</h3>

                        <p>5.1. We may disclose your personal information or data to any of our employees, officers, insurers, professional advisers, agents, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy. Personal information is only supplied to a third party when it is required for the delivery of our services. </p>
                        <p>5.2. We may from time to time need to disclose personal information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. </p>

                        <p>5.4. Your data and personal information is stored in Australia, unless you have specifically requested to store it in one of our other data centre locations. </p>
                        <p>5.5. In two specific circumstances, we may store, process or transfer data to locations in countries located outside of Australia.

                        <p>5.6.

                        <p>5.8. Many of our services let you share information with others.

                        <p>6.2. All of our technology and processes are not, however, guarantees of security. You should also bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to us, or receive from us, and any such exchange of information is carried out at your own risk.
